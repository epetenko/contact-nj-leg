# contact-nj-leg
A tool to lookup your New Jersey reps by your town.

This is a JQuery-based tool that allows New Jersey residents to enter their town and find their legislators. An example here: https://s3.amazonaws.com/nj-apps/Contact_nj_legislator/Contact_leg.html

Basic notes:
- The csv contains the data for the tool, as well as the json
- Contact_leg and Contact_sans_header are different designs of the same tool. Same with custom_2.css vs custom_3.css
- Main js code is in get_the_reps.js
- Used jquery.auto-complete.js for auto-complete, but there are plenty of other autocomplete libraries around.
